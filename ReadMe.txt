Please read the attached NMROM paper first.

Note: You have to generate data first and then train models.

General steps are
Step 1: Build data for ROMs
Step 2: Train models
Step 3: Find hyper-reduction residual basis dimension and the number of residual samples
Step 4: Solve problems with ROMs

Numerical examples in the paper include
ROMs vs reduced dimension (test_red-dim)
ROMs vs number of train parameter instances (test_nparam)
Hyper-reduction of ROMs with the target parameter being 1 (test_DEIM)
Hyper-reduced ROMs vs target parameter (test_predictive)
